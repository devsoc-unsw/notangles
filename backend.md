## Welcome to the backend docs ðŸ’¯

Stuff to know:

- Nest has 3 main types of files:
  - [Controller](https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers)
  - [Service (which are a type of Provider)](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers)
  - [Module](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules)
- We have 3 main modules, each containing at least 1 of each of the above types of files.
  - `src/sum` (The example one to look at if you haven't used Nest before.)
