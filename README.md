# Notangles

[Notangles](https://notangles.csesoc.unsw.edu.au/) is an interactive drag-and-drop timetable planner designed to help UNSW students plan their ideal weekly timetable.

I (Peter) forked this repo to add the ICS file feature as well as patch that feature when I made some mistakes with it.
